Colloboration

**What is Colloboration?**
- Collaboration between employees inside an organization

*The BIG Question: How can we improve collaboration inside organizations?*
  1. How can we describe collaboration patterns between employees?
  2. How can we map these collaboration patterns?
  3. How can we evaluate these collaboration patterns?
  4. How can we improve these collaboration patterns?
  
 **Answer: Using Organizational Network Analysi (ONA)**
 

**I. Describing Colloboration Networks**

Types of Organizational Networks
  - Collaboration networks (information flows, knowledge sharing)
  - Communication networks
  - Friendship networks
  - Advice networks
  - Trust networks etc.

How Can We Describe Collaboration Patterns?
1. Network size
2. Network strength
3. Network range
4. Network density
5. Network centrality


**II. Mapping Colloboration Networks**

Data can be collected 
1. Surveys
2. Other sources

*Collecting Network Data via Surveys: Some Issues

PROS:
- Customized, detailed information from target sample

CONS:
- High response rates are critical
- Network cannot be too large
- Survey cannot be too long
- Questions must be worded and interpreted with care
- Confidentiality is critical
- Relatively costly method of data collection


*Collecting Network Data from Other Sources
- Big Data: interactions via email, phone calls, computer conferencing, bulletin boards, social media, etc.
- Archival Records: corporate databases - e.g. info on shared project assignments, work histories, event attendance
- public databases - e.g. info on co-patenting, co-authorship, co-citations
- Fieldwork: observations, diaries, electronic tags, etc.

Collecting Network Data from Other Sources: Some Issues
PROS:
- Information on larger networks may be available
- May be less invasive
- May be less expensive
- May provide more objective measures
CONS:
- Privacy concerns
- What do available measures actually capture?
- Large datasets can generate statistically significant but unimportant
findings


**III. Evaluating Colloboration Networks**

Correlational & multivariate analysis
- Identify relationships between network variables and outcomes

CAUTION!!!There is no one “best” collaboration network for every organization in every situation! 
To understand what’s best for your particular organization in your particular situation, you’ll need to collect and analyze the data!

Measure Outcomes
Gabage in and Gabage out
Collecting and Analyzing high quality data is very important!!!

**IV. Intervening/Improving in Collaboration Networks**

How Can We Improve Collaboration Patterns?
-  Is more collaboration needed?   More is not always better!

- Where is more collaboration needed?  Build ties strategically
- How to increase collaboration? 
  1. Provide motivation to build ties
  2. Emphasize & promote collaboration
  3. Recognize & reward collaboration
- Provide opportunities to build ties: like Cross-functional meetings, conference calls, job rotations, site visits, events, etc

Intervening in Collaboration Networks: Five Examples
1. Reducing employee overload
2. Improving resiliency of global teams
3. Reducing collaboration inefficiencies
4. Eliminating organizational silos
5. Enhancing career paths
