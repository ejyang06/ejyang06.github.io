## The staffing Cycle
- hiring
- Attrition
- Movement within the organization


### Hiring
Hiring 1: predicting performance
 -kind of inteviews
 - illusion of validity: we think we know more than what we actually know about people
 
Hiring 2: tuning predictors
 - predictors: 
    background - resume
    test score - gpa (google found gpa is not predicting performance)
    
prediciting new hire performance hints:
1. comparing Apples with Apples (eg. similiar level of job experience)
2. Disentagling influences (apply common-sense)
3. Accounting for Selection (who go hired and who stayed)

Hiring 3: Using Data Analysis to Predict Performance
- multivariate regression to separate out infulence of different characteristics
- selection correction: to account for who was and attrition from sample eg. Heckman selection corrections

Data Analysis compare to human judgement"
- leaves much variation unexplained
- Algo is some studies works better than managers

### Internal Mobility

Internal Mobility 1: Analyzing Promotibility
- How well does success in the current job predict performance in a
higher level job?

### Causality
correlation is causation!
- Two types of casuality problem:
 1. omitted variable bias.  X <-O-> Y
 2. reverse casuality: x<-Y
- approaches to addressing causality
1. measure and control for omitted variables
2. look for evidence to rule out alternatives
3. Exloit natural sources of randomization
4. conduct experiment

### Attrition

- AttritionL understanding and reducing turnover
problems:
 - hiring cost
 - training cost
 - loss of crititcal knolwedge
 - Impact on customer relationships
Levers:
 - infom hiring strategy
 - target interventions (improve conditions, address unmet needs, train managers, focus retention efforts)
 - Target interventions

Predicting Attrition:
common predictors:
 - manager
 - pre-hired background
 - Type of work / project / function
 - Performance evaluations
 - Geography
 - Social network behavior
 - update their linkedin profoile
