### 1.1 - Research Design and Sampling - Part 1

I. Experiments
Randomization matters

1. Experiments
- Dependent variable
- Factors
- Control or randomization of disturbing variables

2. Quasi-experimental: observational

Quasi-experiments, such as the Doll and HIll
tobacco use and lung cancer study, do not use randomization to assign subjects
to treatments, or to select subjects from a population.

3. Survey samples: observational 

### 1.1 - Research Design and Sampling - Part 2
Survey is observational - in actual setting in a particular point of time

- The 3 R's
• Realism - study design needs to be embedded in a realistic setting

• Randomization - Experiments use randomization to assure equality across groups to make sure 
then that the comparisons yield conclusions only about important differences between the groups, 
the ones that matter. The difference being experimental condition, no experimental condition experience.

• Representation - Randomization actually doesn't guarantee representation. 
We'll see this, and so one needs to go further. Experiments seldom make any attempt, 
sometimes but very rarely, make any attempt to have representative groups that they examine. 
They're going to take individuals who are convenient, available, perhaps haphazardly assembled for their studies.

### 1.3 - Why Sample At All?


1. Census or sample
- During conceptualization, a researcher considers the RELEVANT
POPULATION for evaluating the theory/hypothesis
- In designing the data collection, the researcher has two concerns
in mind:
  - External validity
  - Cost/benefit calculations for the overall cost of the study

- A census involves an enumeration of a population. When the
population is large:
  1. It is costly
  2. It is time consuming
  3. It may not be feasible with complete precision (US Census as an example) 
  
- A sample involves a selection of a representative subset of a
population in order to draw inferences to the population
    - Collecting data from a sample of a large population is FAR LESS costly and FAR LESS time consuming
 1.Recruitment directly – volunteer samples
 2.Lists, selection, & then recruitment
 3.Lists, selection, recruitment, & nonresponse
 
2. Accurary
Validity also known as unbiasedness in statistics,
validity is a summary statement about whether on average the process is getting
the right result.

3. Probabilities
- Non-probability sampling
    - Haphazard, convenience, or accidental sampling
    - Purposive sampling or expert choice
    - Quota sampling
    - Substitution (for nonresponse)
    - Online panels
    - River sampling

- Probability sampling
    - Simple random selection
    - Stratified selection
    - Cluster samples
    - Systematic samples
    - More complex samples: probabilities proportionate to size

4. Frames
-  List frame
-  Area frame
-  Problems
  - Missing elements
  - Duplicate listings
  - Clusters
  - Blanks or ineligibles

5. Techniques
- Simple random sampling
- Systematic sampling
- Stratified sampling
  - Proportionate allocation
  - Disproportionate allocation
 
- Cluster sampling
- Two-stage sampling
- Probability proportionate to size sampling
- Stratified probability proportionate to size sampling
- Multistage sampling
- Multiple phase sampling

6. Deficiencies
-  Nonresponse
  - Total/unit
  - Item
- Noncoverage
- Compensation: weighting 
  - Unequal probabilities
  - Nonresponse
  - Noncoverage (poststratification) 
    -Make the sample distribution conform to known population distribution
    
7. Complex Design
- Complex designs typically involve one or more of …
  - Stratification
  - Clusters
  - Weights
- Estimation becomes complex
  - Even a simple mean or proportion requires non-standard techniques
 
- Standard software cannot handle complex sample designs
correctly
- Estimating precision becomes more complex as well
- Methods of variance estimation must be considered
  - Taylor series approximation
  - Balanced or Jackknife repeated replication
- Computer software available for these methods
  -  Requires stratum, cluster, and weight on each sample records
