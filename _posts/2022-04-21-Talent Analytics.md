# Talent Analytics: The Importance of Context
 
 Motivating case: promotions
 * vital to firm's health
 How to do this well?
 
 Talent Analytics Challenges
 1) Context
 2) Interdependence
 3) Self-fulling Prophercies
 4) Reverse Causality

#### I. context
problem: neglect context when evaluationg performance
 - over-attribute performance to personal traits (personality, skills etc)
 - under-attribute performance to the sitatuin that the person was in (easy vs difficult task, helpful colleagues vs hurtful collegues, good economy vs bad)

* The "fundamental attribution error"

"Don't confuse brains and a bull market"

Example Case:

So...
- Apple to Apple comparison - put employees on even playing field
- Think of performance relative to expectation, as driven by team, product, industry, economy, boss etc

### II. Interdependence
- A humbling amount of our works depend on other people

Example case:

Not only the skills of the analyst, but the team the analysis is in.

So...
- Means performance evaluation is often best done at the group level
- performance measures designed to assess contribution to team performance eg. network analysis
(eg. who team member would go to for advise and for help)


### III. Self-fullinging Prophecies
- People tend toward performing consistent with expecatations. High expection increase performance, low expectation decrease

Example case:

The Matthew Effect
"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"

Early advantages often accumulate
- consumer goods
- eudcation
- careers

those with early advantage will be increasingly priviliged over time

So...
- Where might your expectations be affecting other behavior
- What steps can you take to protect evaluation processes from these expectations
- How can you ensure euqal access to valuable resources?

### IV. Reverse Causality
- When we see two correlated factors, we tend to believe one caused the other, especially when there is an intuitive direction.
 
 Example Case
 eg. are charismatic leaders more successful?
 A study found from 128 CEOs in a longitudial panel 
 that Charimsatic CEOs did not have more future success, but
 successful CEOs were perceived as more charismatic!
 
 # Special Topics: Tests & Algo
 
 Can an algo hire better than human?
 
 Pros
 - processing efficiency
 - broader search
 - unbiased

Cons
- Hyper-focused: no sense of balancing
- Low explanatory power: doesn't explain the downstream variants

Hiring: 
prescription
- Do the Science: rigorous testing in the relevant setting
- Provide human oversight: program, test, error-check
- Use multilple tools: draw on as many diverse signals as possible
